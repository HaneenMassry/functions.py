what is this you can have a question and most people say the box but I've met a small group of people who told me that this is not a box and what's fascinating about this group of people is they're the ones that have pioneered space travel explore the depths of our oceans and created them the most impenetrable Fortress is all before the age of five course I'm talking about my kids they told me that this was not a box but rather a rocket ship submarine

16
00:00:54.500000-->00:01:46
and I no longer see a little soccer ball here it's actually got some life to its little Dalmatian puppy I no longer see the light at the glass is half-empty in fact I don't even see a glass at all for me it's actually a tasty piece of chocolate cake you and I can still access the childlike Wonder we can still see and dream with this Wonder although you regain your sense of childlike wonder if you will with me that one Christmas boxes like this is wrapped and placed under a tree and an excited little boy comes running down

16
00:01:46-->00:01:59
because to him it's a deep dark cave hello so he's going to dig for Buried Treasure and that's when he discovered that no longer hold

16
00:01:59-->00:02:38.500000
find a box he looked in his room he searched the backyard and then he found it in the garage and ran to go play with it he opened it up and inside where winter jackets and this was the date of the boy learned with the boxes actually made to do the store things now the boxes just a regular box the boy ended up packing up things to go to college in that box couple years later

16
00:02:38.500000-->00:03:04.500000
and my kids were dreaming with the box and they said Daddy will playing rocket ship come play with us it's been a while since I played with the box but I fired on the engine for him sure enough for all these years she still ran and we headed to space

16
00:03:04.500000-->00:03:50
possibilities so for you and I as we approach life in and try to solve new problems if we're able to remove our assumptions for a moment we can see with this new childlike Wonder once again so I want to test this out and see if it's worked at this experience we gained a little sense of your wonder my desktop image on the screen and I want you to hold back your assumption so on the desktop screen you might have a few assumptions that you can't hold back

16
00:03:50-->00:03:53.500000
so the next time somebody tells you
